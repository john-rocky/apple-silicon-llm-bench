# Ordering is not cosmetic:
#   * `install` wipes the ML Drift kernel cache, so the runs right after it are FIRST-EVER,
#     not cold — LiteRT prefill reads ~1,650 tok/s there against ~3,234 once the cache is on
#     disk. `warmup` exists to get past that, and its output is thrown away.
#   * `stage` needs the cable; the capture needs it out (charging drives thermal `fair`
#     within ~2 cells). Hence the explicit `unplug-wait` between them.
#   * every cell is launched fresh with `--console`, which returns when the app exits, so
#     nothing is pulled before the runs it is waiting on have landed.
#
# Validation is post-hoc, per the 07-20 lesson: battery-temperature telemetry is a lagging
# long-window average, so gate on the app-recorded initialThermalState/batteryState in the
# result JSON (that is what `analyze` reads), never on a temperature poll here.

# `Gemma4Text.swift:245` builds `vProj` only when `!useKeqV`, so on a KV-shared layer the
# module has no slot and the extra key fails the load with

# NOTE: every published MLX E2B cell was measured on 2c3e507. Moving to 2387675 is a
